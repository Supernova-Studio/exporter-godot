[Supernova](https://supernova.io) is a design system platform that manages your assets, tokens, components and allows you to write spectacular documentations for your entire teams. And because you found your way here, you are probably interested in its most advanced functionality - automatic hand-off of design and development assets, tokens and data in general. To learn everything Supernova, please check out our [developer documentation](https://developers.supernova.io/).


# Godot Exporter


The Godot Exporter allows you to **produce production-ready code for your product tokens (such as colors) defined inside your design system** in such a way that you can immediately use them to style your game elements. Specifically, this exporter automates the coding of:

- [x] Color definitions
- [x] Gradients
- [x] Radii
- [x] Measures
- [x] Strings

The exporter will generate a class per style type with a static variable for each specific token. If provided, it will also include each token's description as a documentation comment. Tokens such as colors or texts are exported as simple variables:

```gdscript
extends Node


# Use this string to greet the player
var main_menu_greeting_token = "Game on, player!"

var main_menu_new_game = "New Game"

var main_menu_option_sound = "Sound: "

var main_menu_option_music = "Music: "

var main_menu_option_quit_game = "Quit Game"
```

Here's an example of the exporter ouput for a single `Red - Black Gradient` gradient token:

```gdscript
extends Node


# This is the red to black gradient.
var red_black_gradient := Gradient.new()
var red_black_gradient_data := {
	0: Color8(255, 0, 0, 255),
	1: Color8(0, 0, 0, 255),
}


func _ready():
	red_black_gradient.offsets = red_black_gradient_data.keys()
	red_black_gradient.colors = red_black_gradient_data.values()
```

## Example Usage

Once you have run the exporter against your design system, you can start using the code in your codebase right away. Here are a few examples of how you can use the output of the Flutter exporter:

### Using the gradient


Setting up the gradient from the example above as a GradientTexture: 

```gdscript
var gradient_texture := GradientTexture.new()
gradient_texture.gradient = red_black_gradient
```

## Installing

You can generate all production ready-code either manually using Supernova's [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SupernovaIO.pulsar-vsc-extension), or automate your code delivery pipeline using Supernova [Design Continuous Delivery](https://supernova.io/automated-code-delivery). In order to make the Supernova Flutter exporter available for your organization so you can start generating code from your design system, please follow the installation guide in our [developer documentation](https://developers.supernova.io/using-exporters/installing-exporters).
